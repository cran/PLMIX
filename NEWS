BUG FIXES
    o   mapPLMIX(...)
    o   random_start(...)
    o   rank_summaries(...)

MAJOR CHANGES
    o   bicPLMIX(...): 
    o   [::] replaced former argument `weights` as `G`.
    o   [::] added default values for the arguments `ref_known` and `ref_vary`.
    o   [::] added the reference Schwarz (1978).
    o   gibbsPLMIX(...): 
	-  added the `centered_start` argument for the random generation of the starting values, similarly to the mapPLMIX(...) and mapPLMIX_multistart(...) functions. 
    o   label_switchPLMIX(...):
    o   [::] added new function to perform label switching adjustment of the posterior MCMC samples, formerly implemented by both the ppcheckPLMIX(...) and the ppcheckPLMIX_cond(...) functions.
    o   mapPLMIX(...): 
    o   [::] modified the default value of the argument `eps` in accordance with that of the related mapPLMIX_multistart(...) function.
      	-  modified the default value of the argument `plot_objective`.
      	-  dropped object `Rho_map` from the output list.
      	-  renamed object `z` of the output list as `z_hat`.
    o   [::] renamed object `classification` of the output list as `class_map`.
    o   [::] `bic` value is computed only for the default flat priors case, otherwise NULL is returned.
    o   mapPLMIX_multistart(...):
    o   [::] recoded default value of the argument `init`.
    o   ppcheckPLMIX(...) and ppcheckPLMIX_cond(...): 
    o   [::] removed former arguments `MAPestP`, `MAPestW`, `ls_adj` and `adj_post_sample` needed for the label switching adjustment, which is currently implemented by the novel label_switchPLMIX(...) function.
    o   [::] removed `final_sampleP` and `final_sampleW` objects from the output.
    o   rank_summaries(...): 
    o   [::] renamed the argument and output object `pairedcomparisons` as `pc`. 
    o   [::] renamed the output object `missing_positions` as `missing_pos`, 
    o   rPLMIX(...):
    o   [::] renamed former `rankingoutput` argument with `format`.
    o   selectPLMIX:
    o   [::] removed argument `log_lik`.

MINOR CHANGES
    o   ppcheckPLMIX(...) and ppcheckPLMIX_cond(...):
    o   [::] added some messages.
    o   "G=" replaced with "G_".
    o   make_partial(...):
    o   [::] renamed argument `probcensoring` as `probcens`.


DOCUMENTATION
    o   The manual has been globally reviewed and improved with additional implementation details and some new examples.
    o   Added new examples for the three data objects `d_apa`, `d_carconf` and `d_dublinwest` showing how to extract the subset of complete orderings from the whole dataset.
    o   Updated reference Mollica and Tardella (2016) as Mollica and Tardella (2017). 
    o   d_german dataset: modified the citation Croon (1989).
    o   mapPLMIX(...) and mapPLMIX_multistart(...):
    o   [::] added the citation Gormley and Murphy (2006).

    o   [::] removed example of label switching adjustment.
    o   selectPLMIX(...): 
    o   [::] added Details section.
    o   [::] renamed output objects `fitting_measures`, `effective_number_of_parameters` and `selection_criteria` as `fitting`, `penalties` and `select_criteria`.

CITATION INFO
    o   Added bibTex entries in the file CITATION.
    o   Updated reference Mollica and Tardella (2016) as Mollica and Tardella (2017) in the CITATION info.
